## Lunarch
A fast and beautiful configuration for Neovim; 100% Written in Lua. This project is written mainly for gruvbox theme lover. Everything is customised according to gruvbox-material. Everything has been made transparent. 

### Required
- Neovim v0.7
- Python and pip
- Nodejs, npm and yarn (for Lsp and more plugins)
- [JetBrainsMono Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/JetBrainsMono.zip)

### Color Scheme
My obsession with [gruvbox-material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material) has made this project an art. Almost everything has been made transparent and beautiful.
Alternatively, one can use NeoSolarized color-scheme which is optimised for full transparency.
